Intro line:
    Hello there, my name is Calcium Sulfur Phosphorus Erbium, or CaSPEr for short, and I 
    am a smart mole. To get me to do things, simply say my commands.
        To get me to explain what a mole is say "mole"
        To get me to become a wizard say "magic"
        To get me to dance say "dance"
        To get me to repeat these commands say "command"

What is a mole?
    A mole is the SI unit for the amount of substance. It is defined as the number of carbon
    atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12. This number is called Avogadro's number and it is 6.022 x 10^23.

    I'm Moley Potter. My favorite spell is Expelliarmus.
